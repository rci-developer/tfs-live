**INVOICE GATEWAY FOR WOOCOMMERCE**

This plugin adds a basic invoice payment option for your customers on the checkout.

It allows the order to go through into Processing status and from there you can generate a separate invoice in your accounting system and have your customer pay outside of WooCommerce.

Once you have been paid you just add the invoice number to the order then change the Order status to Completed.

**Brought to you by:**

This plugin was brought to you by the folks at [Wholesale Suite](https://wholesalesuiteplugin.com).

Users of our popular free [Wholesale Prices extension for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-wholesale-prices/) were asking for the option to provide an invoice payment option for their wholesale customers.

We decided to give this feature away to not just our customers but to everyone using WooCommerce.

If you want to say thanks, please leave us a rating on the right :)
